# Ajax-with-XHR #

This was a mini project provided to me through Udacity.  It listens to a form/search field to search for any topic you type in upon pressing the submit button.

This application makes XMLHttpRequests through Unsplash, and The New York Times to retrieve images, and articles to be displayed on this application.  Depending on what you type into the search bar that is!

It uses the `.open();`, `.onerror`, `.onload`, `.send();`, `setRequestHeader();`, `new XMLHttpRequest();`, `JSON.parse();`,  as well as `GET`.

## Instructions ##

To use this application:
1. Simply type any word you wish into the search bar.
2. Click the Submit Button.
  * You will notice the image will load, as well as the Authors name, and what the image is about.
3. Click on any of the articles that load to read       more about the subject you've searched!
